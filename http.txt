HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication on the World Wide Web. It facilitates the transfer of hypertext, typically in the form of HTML documents, between clients (such as web browsers) and servers. HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where clients request resources and servers provide responses. It is stateless, meaning each request is independent, and it uses a variety of methods (GET, POST, etc.) to perform actions like retrieving, submitting, or modifying data on the web.
