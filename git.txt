Git is a distributed version control system that enables tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing a history of changes, branches, and merges. Developers can work independently on their copies of the code, and Git facilitates merging their changes into a shared repository. Key commands include 'git clone' for creating a local copy, 'git add' to stage changes, 'git commit' to save changes, and 'git push' to upload changes to a remote repository. Branching and merging features enhance collaboration and code management.
